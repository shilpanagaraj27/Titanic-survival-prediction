## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more. We use machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers who were on board the Titanic. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation and Setup
